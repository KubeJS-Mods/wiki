Multiblocked (mbd) is an extremely flexible yet vanilla-esque multiblock mod, that embraces aspects of MultiblockTweaker and Modular Machinery.
The goal was to make it as easy as possible for modpack/mod authors to create multiblocks to interacte IO from other mods, and provide as much detail control as possible. Mbd is essentially both a tweaker mod and a library mod that provides rendering and logic APIs.
