## `FTBChunksEvents`

- After
```js
FTBChunksEvents.after("claim", (event) => {
  let chunkPos = event.chunk.pos.chunkPos;
  let player = event.player.username;
  event.server.tell(
    Component.aqua(player)
      .append(Component.literal(" has claimed Chunk at: "))
      .append(Component.green(chunkPos))
  )
})
```
`.after` executes code after a Chunk has been claimed.
This example sends a message to everyone, saying who claimed a chunk, and the claimed chunks's position.
`.after('string')` The string here is for which event to listen for. Current available operations:
```
'claim'
'unclaim'
'load'
'unload'
```
---
- Before
==`.before` is currently broken! If it is applied, you will not be able to claim Chunks anymore!==
It works just like `.after`, but *before* the specified operation.
