startup: "Scripts go into the {{st-s}} folder. Startup scripts run once, at startup, on both the client and server. Most events that require registering or modifying something at game start (like custom blocks, items, and fluids) will be Startup events."
server: "Scripts go into the {{se-s}} folder. It will be reloaded when you run `/reload` command. Server events are always accessible, even in single-player worlds. Most events that make changes to the world while the game is running (such as breaking blocks, teleporting players, or adding recipes) will go here."
client: "Scripts go into the {{cl-s}} folder. Will be reloaded when you press `F3+T`. Most changes that are per-client (such as resource packs, Painter, and JEI) are client events."
