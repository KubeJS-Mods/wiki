server: "Scripts go into the {{se-s}} folder. It will be reloaded when you run `/reload` command. Server events are always accessible, even in single-player worlds. Most events that make changes to the world while the game is running (such as breaking blocks, teleporting players, or adding recipes) will go here."
event-type-client: "Client"
client: "Scripts go into the {{cl-s}} folder. Will be reloaded when you press `F3+T`. Most changes that are per-client (such as resource packs, Painter, and JEI) are client events."
