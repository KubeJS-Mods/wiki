The `data` folder acts just like the `data` folder inside of a datapack - however, it will always load - you can't disable it from loading in any way.
Just like normal datapacks, it can be reloaded by running `/reload`.
On KubeJS 6.1+, you can also drop a datapack `.zip` into the `data` folder to load it.
