Consumer is a generic method that usually means that method has a callback function.

If your method looks something like

`object`$$.example(callback: Consumer<string>)

Then the script for this will be:
```js
object.example(obj => {
  console.log(obj); // obj is a string
})
```
Of course, the argument name in callback doesn't matter.
