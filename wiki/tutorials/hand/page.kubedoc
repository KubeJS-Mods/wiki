To get the ID of an item with NBT data/components, you can use the `/kjs hand` command (`/kjs_hand` on versions before 1.19).
Here's how to use it:
. Put the item in your main hand
. Run the command
. <#output>
. Click on the green text (the item ID) to copy it

>>> #output
Now you should see something similar to this:
