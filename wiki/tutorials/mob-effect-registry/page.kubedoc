You can create custom Mob Effects:

|> 1.19.2+
```js
StartupEvents.registry('mob_effect', event => {
  event.create('custom_effect') // Create the Effect. Can also have Types, but vanilla Kube has none.
    .color(0x000000) // Sets the color of the Effect's Particles.
    .beneficial() // Categorizes the Effect as Beneficial.
    .effectTick(ctx => { // EffectTick is where the magic happens. It has tooooons of methods for you to use, which activate every Tick.
      ctx.absorptionAmount = 2 // For example, this will apply an Absorption heart.
      ctx.modifyAttribute('minecraft:generic.max_health', 'identifier', 1, 'addition') // This modifies an Attribute, which will increase an Entity's Max Health by 1 HP.
    })
    .modifyAttribute() // This method can also be used here, but is not recommended because the modified Attribute continues to stay modified until the Entity dies.
})
```
<||> 1.18.2 and below
```js
onEvent('mob_effect.registry', event => {
  event.create('custom_effect') // Create the Effect. Can also have Types, but vanilla Kube has none.
    .color(0x000000) // Sets the color of the Effect's Particles.
    .beneficial() // Categorizes the Effect as Beneficial.
    .effectTick(ctx => { // EffectTick is where the magic happens. It has tooooons of methods for you to use, which activate every Tick.
      ctx.absorptionAmount = 2 // For example, this will apply an Absorption heart.
      ctx.modifyAttribute('minecraft:generic.max_health', 'identifier', 1, 'addition') // This modifies an Attribute, which will increase an Entity's Max Health by 1 HP.
    })
    .modifyAttribute() // This method can also be used here, but is not recommended because the modified Attribute continues to stay modified until the Entity dies.
})
